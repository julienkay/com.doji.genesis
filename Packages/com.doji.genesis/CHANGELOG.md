### Removed

- Removed the option to import skyboxes directly via their ID.

## [0.1.3] - 2023-03-07

### Fixed

- Fixed possible IndexOutOfRangeException with bilinear depth sampling when extracting meshes.

## [0.1.2] - 2023-02-24

## [0.1.1] - 2023-02-24

### Fixed

## [0.1.0] - 2023-02-23

### Added

- Add option to extract mesh from a DepthSkybox object.

### Changed

- Rotate and mirror the output of depth estimation so it matches the input texture.

## [0.0.2] - 2023-02-23

### Fixed

- Fixed depth calculations. Absolute depth is now inferred from inverse depth by exposing a scale factor as a material property. This should get rid of distorted areas near the poles and depth in general should feel be more correct.
